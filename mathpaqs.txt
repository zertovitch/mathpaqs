MATHPAQS
========
_____________________________________________________________________________
Important note: it is better to unpack the Zip archive
with its subdirectory structure. How to (re-)do this ?
It depends on the unpacker:

  unzipada mathpaqs             with Zip-Ada's UnZipAda
  pkunzip -d mathpaqs           with PKWare's PKUnZip
  unzip mathpaqs                with InfoZip's UnZip
  unzip -aa -L mathpaqs         to force lower case in names and text file
                                                line terminations under Unix
  "Use archive's 
     directories" option        with AZip
  "Use Folder Names" option     with WinZip

(A)  Mathematical, 100% portable, packages in Ada.
     If you see "Ada 83" it also compiles
     on Ada 95, 2005 and 2012 compilers.
     The list of packages below is sorted by topics.
     Each topic has a subdirectory. Of course there are many possible
     interactions, like between Multi-precision numbers and
     Algebra (Euclidean_Ring_Tools) - it is like combining
     mathematics fields...
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                        integral division), it gives the Greatest Common Divisor
                        and the Bezout factors.
